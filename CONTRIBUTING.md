# npm command-line client support issues

Thanks for using `node.js` and `npm` for development!

Unfortunately, you are probably here because you have run into a problem with `node` and/or `npm` and/or some other program that uses `npm`.  You may be looking at a page or more of error message text, and you don't know what to do net.

First of all, **DON'T PANIC**.  This is normal, we've all been through it, and it does pass.  We're here to help.

## Turnaround time

When you submit a support request, you will get a follow-up between 4 and 48 hours later.  Many of us are volunteers and we work on this as a hobby/community support activity.  But hang in there!  We will get to you.

You can try the #npm channel on irc.freenode.net, as well.  The #npm channel is a community resource, not an "official" support channel.

## When you submit an issue

* Tell us what you were trying to do.  A good description of your goal will help us answer your question more specifically.  Some examples are "I'm trying to install `ember-cli`", or "I'm trying to publish my-module@1.0.1 to the `npm` repository."

* Include relevant information such as the OS you are running, the versions of `node` and `npm`, and the specific `npm` command you are running that gives you the error.  
  (**Tip**: if `npm` produces an error log, it will be stored in the file `npm-debug.log`.  That file contains all the necessary OS, version, and command information. You can upload the file at https://gist.github.com/ and provide a link in the issue you create.)

## Troubleshooting resources

* The <a href="./README.md">README</a> for this repository is a quick troubleshooting guide that helps to resolve most issues.  Please have a look at it and try the troubleshooting steps.  (That's the first thing we're going to ask you do when we follow up on your report, so you might as well get it out of the way now...)
