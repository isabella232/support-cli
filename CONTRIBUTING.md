# npm command-line client support issues

Thanks for using `node.js` and `npm` for development!

Unfortunately, you are probably here because you have run into a problem with `node` and/or `npm` and/or some other program that uses `npm`.  You may be looking at a page or more of error message text, and you don't know what to do net.

First of all, **DON'T PANIC**.  This is normal, we've all been through it, 

## When you submit an issue

* Tell us what you were trying to do.  A good description of your goal will help us answer your question more specifically.  Some examples are "I'm trying to install `ember-cli`", or "I'm trying to publish my-module@1.0.1 to the `npm` repository."

* Include relevant information such as the OS you are running, the versions of `node` and `npm`, and the specific `npm` command you are running that gives you the error.  
  (**Tip**: if `npm` produces an error log, it will be stored in the file `npm-debug.log`.  That file contains all the necessary OS, version, and command information. You can upload the file at https://gist.github.com/ and provide a link in the issue you create.)
